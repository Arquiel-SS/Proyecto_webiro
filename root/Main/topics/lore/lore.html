          The world of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a fantasy spin on Sengoku-Era Japan. The lands of Ashina are steeped
          in deep lore, mythology and history. Spirits and monsters roam the country alongside samurai and shinobi. And
          the very soil itself is infused with waters of everlasting life. As Ashina prepares to make it's final stand,
          a lone shinobi begins a perilous search for his missing lord - the young Divine Heir, whose blood is coveted
          by all those seeking power.

          The time is Sengoku. <br>

          Japan is fractured into many independent nations entangled in ceaseless war.
          Beyond endless snowy peaks lies the land of Ashina - a realm rife with sacred earth and ancient mystery.
          For years the Ashina were overrun by invaders and forced to serve foreign lords. <br><br>

          That is until twenty years ago, when Sword Saint Isshin Ashina ignited a bloody coup to retake his homeland.
          Isshin's skill with a blade was unrivaled, and he inspired fierce loyalty in his countrymen. Under his
          leadership Ashina was reclaimed by its rightful rulers and a new time of peace began.
          But now, Ashina once again faces an invasive threat. One more powerful than any before it.<br><br>

          The Interior Ministry has set it's sights on Ashina and will stop at nothing to unify all of Japan under one
          banner. Genichiro Ashina, Isshin's grandson, has assumed command and desperately searches for a means to
          defend his home.
          Soon though, he realizes the inevitable: “Ashina cannot be defended by normal means, not anymore.”<br><br>

          And so the Divine Heir is kidnapped,
          alone in the world save for a single shinobi.
          His loyal wolf - Sekiro.<br><br>

          This is a tale of a Lord and his Retainer, and their journey to return balance to the land. <br>

        About the Sengoku Era

      <div class="lore-text">

          The Sengoku Era in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is the setting that was chosen for the game. The Sengoku Era was
          a century-long period in Japanese history that was known for its military conflict between social, political
          upheaval and warlordism where countless leaders of Japan fought each other in a never-ending battle for
          claiming power and land.<br><br>

          According to an interview from the Washington Post and Hidetaka Miyazaki, Miyazaki mentions: "As we wanted to
          create a setting in which a ninja character could play an active role, we considered both the Sengoku period
          and the Edo period. The reason for picking Sengoku over Edo was that the former is an era during the Middle
          Ages, whereas the latter is closer to early-modern times. A more medieval setting allowed for the impression
          that various ancient and mystical elements still exist in the world, which is something we found very
          appealing."<br><br>

          Similar to this, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice takes place in a re-imagined 16th century Sengoku Period of Japan,
          where certain parts of Ashina is overrun by formidable leaders hungry for power. Players will take control of
          Sekiro also known as "The Wolf" who was sent and given a mission to rescue the young divine Heir, Lord Kuro
          who carries the power of resurrection that is running in his blood.<br><br>

          Later on, Sekiro faces Genichiro Ashina where he eventually fails to protect the divine heir, loses his left
          arm over Genichiro's blade and is left to die. However, it seems the Gods are in Sekiro's favor as he survives
          and awakens in a temple with the aid of a mysterious man known as the Sculptor - Sekiro awakens as a vengeful
          shinobi equipped with a new tool along with a new found power of Resurrection who is on a quest to rescue the
          divine heir from various forces wanting to use the divine heir's blood for their own intent.<br><br>

          Lore Theory: The Sengoku era spans from 1467 (beginning of the Onin War) to 1590 (Siege of Odawara). The
          events of Sekiro, however, likely took place at some point between 1576 and 1590, because the antagonist of
          Ashina is called the Interior Ministry (内府; naifu in the Japanese). More specifically, it can be either 1576
          or 1580, depending on who the historical origin of Isshin Ashina is.<br><br>

          Nobunaga Oda, the first of the Three Great Unifiers of Japan, held the position of the Interior Minister of
          the Court (the 4th highest in the hierarchy of the ancient Japanese court system) between 1576–1577. Tomonori
          Kitabatake, a possible candidate for the historical origin of Isshin Ashina was killed by the assassins of
          Nobunaga in 1576.
          Note that Nobunaga also held the Right Minister of the Court (the 3rd highest) between 1577–1582. He was
          usually called Oda Right Ministry (Oda Ufu; 織田右府) in this period. It is possible that "the Inner Ministry" in
          Sekiro is an allusion to "the Right Ministry" rather than strict historical reference.<br>
          Nobukatsu Oda, a son of Nobunaga, held the position of the Interior Minister between 1577-1590. Moriuji
          Ashina, another possible candidate for the historical origin of Isshina Ashina, died in 1580.

          "Never forget the Iron Code."<br><br>

          "Looks like death is not in your fate... just yet."<br><br>

          Shinobi in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is another term that is used to identify a Ninja - where during the
          Sengoku Era, Shinobis equipped with the skills of assassination, infiltration, espionage, and sabotage
          existed.<br><br>

          In Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, players will take control of a Shinobi named Sekiro or The Wolf who is equipped
          with a Prosthetic Arm, as well as a Resurrective power that separates him from the rest of the Shinobi. He is
          sworn to follow the Shinobi's Iron Code of protecting the Divine Heir with his life from dangerous forces who
          are after the power of Resurrection, and possibly reform and save the land of Ashina.
